# Access control (roles + permissions) - backend specification

**For:** the backend developer. **From:** the frontend team.
**Status:** the frontend console is finished (admin screen "Access control") and tested against a mock
(`tests/mock-backend/server.mjs`, search for `access control`). **Nothing below exists on the real server yet.**
Until it does, the screen shows "The backend does not support access control yet" and nothing is enforced.

The UI only hides or disables things. **The server is the security boundary: every route listed in section 5 must
check the permission itself and answer `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`.** Never trust the browser.

---

## 1. What the admin can do (the product)

1. **Master switch** (ON / OFF) for the whole feature.
   - OFF: today's rules apply exactly as now (system admin / team manager / editor / viewer). Custom presets and per-person overrides are **kept but ignored**.
   - ON: every request is also checked against the caller's effective permissions (section 3).
2. **Roles** per person: **Admin**, **Member**, **Viewer** (read-only).
3. **Role presets**: for Member and Viewer, tick exactly which permissions the role has. Admin always has everything.
4. **Per-person overrides**: for one person, each permission can be `Default` (follow the role) / `Allow` (extra) / `Block` (removed).
5. **Preview as**: the admin can look at the app as another person (UI only, no backend call).
6. **History**: who changed what, and when.

## 2. Roles

| Role | Meaning | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | System admin. All permissions, cannot be restricted. | `member.role === 'admin'` (already exists) |
| `viewer` | Read-only. | The person is `viewer` in **every** team they belong to (and is not a system admin) and belongs to at least one team. Team role `viewer` already exists. |
| `member` | Everyone else. | default |

The frontend changes roles with calls that already exist: system admin via `PATCH /member/:id { role: 'admin'|'member' }`
(**please support `role` there, admins only** - not in the current document) and viewer via
`POST /team/updateMemberRoleInTeam { role: 'viewer'|'editor' }` for each team. So you only need to *derive* the role as above.

Guard rails: an admin cannot change or delete **their own** role; the **last admin** can never be demoted or deleted (`409 LAST_ADMIN`).

## 3. Permission keys (fixed catalog - use these exact strings)

| Group | Key | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| See | `view.overview` | Overview page |
| | `view.tasks` | Tasks list / board / calendar |
| | `view.teams` | Teams page |
| | `view.members` | Members directory |
| | `view.assignments` | "My assignments" |
| | `view.reports` | Dashboards, burn-down, workload, time reports |
| Tasks | `task.create` | Create tasks (also from templates) |
| | `task.edit` | Edit title/dates/priority/tags/subtasks/schedule/estimate |
| | `task.delete` | Delete (soft delete) and bulk delete, restore |
| | `task.assign` | Add / remove assignees |
| | `task.status` | Change own assignment status, bulk status |
| | `task.comment` | Write / delete own comments |
| | `task.attach` | Upload / delete own attachments |
| | `task.logTime` | Log / delete own time entries |
| | `task.share` | Create / revoke public share links |
| Teams & people | `team.create` | Create teams |
| | `team.manage` | Add/remove members, change team roles, rename |
| | `team.delete` | Delete / restore teams |
| | `member.invite` | Create member accounts |
| | `member.edit` | Rename, deactivate, reset password, delete, change system role |
| Data | `report.export` | CSV / PDF exports |

`access.manage` (this console) is **not** a key: only a system admin can use `/access/*`, always.

### 3.1 Default presets (used until an admin changes them)

- **admin**: all keys (not editable).
- **member**: `view.overview view.tasks view.teams view.members view.assignments view.reports task.create task.edit task.status task.comment task.attach task.logTime task.share report.export`
- **viewer**: `view.overview view.tasks view.teams view.members view.assignments`

### 3.2 Resolution (must be exactly this)

```
role      = admin | viewer | member            (section 2)
if role == admin                  -> everything allowed
set       = preset[role]
set      += overrides[user].allow
set      -= overrides[user].deny               (Block wins over Allow and over the preset)
allowed(key) = access.enabled == false  ? true  : set.has(key)
```
When `enabled == false` the **existing** authorization rules still apply (system admin / team manager / viewer).
When `enabled == true` a request needs **both**: the existing rule **and** the permission. (A permission never lets someone
do something the existing rules forbid; e.g. `task.delete` does not let a member delete another team's task.)
Viewer team-role enforcement (`403 VIEWER_READ_ONLY`) stays as is.

## 4. Data model

```js
AccessConfig (single document)
  { _id, enabled: Boolean (default false),
    presets: { member: [key], viewer: [key] },      // admin is implicit
    updatedAt, updatedBy }

AccessOverride (one per person that has any override)
  { _id, member: ObjectId (unique), allow: [key], deny: [key], updatedAt, updatedBy }

AccessAudit (append-only)
  { _id, actor: ObjectId, action: 'access.enabled'|'access.disabled'|'preset.changed'|'override.changed'|'role.changed',
    target?: ObjectId, text: String, before?: Mixed, after?: Mixed, createdAt }
```
Validate keys against the catalog (ignore/reject unknown), de-duplicate, a key may not be in both `allow` and `deny`.
Deleting a member deletes their override.

## 5. Endpoints

All need `Authorization: Bearer`. Envelope `{ message, data }`, errors `{ message, code, ... }`.

| Method & path | Who | Body / result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /access/me` | **any signed-in user** | `{ enabled, role: 'admin'\|'member'\|'viewer', permissions: [key] }` - the **effective** list, already resolved by the server (when `enabled=false` return the full catalog so the UI shows everything). The frontend calls this after every sign-in and on `/changes` events. |
| `GET /access/config` | admin | `{ enabled, rolePresets: { member:[key], viewer:[key] } }` |
| `PUT /access/config` | admin | body any of `{ enabled: Boolean, rolePresets: { member:[key], viewer:[key] } }` -> saved config. Audit entry per change. |
| `GET /access/users` | admin | `[ { memberId, allow:[key], deny:[key] } ]` (only people with overrides) |
| `PUT /access/users/:memberId` | admin | `{ allow:[key], deny:[key] }`; both empty = delete the override. Returns the saved document. `404 USER_NOT_FOUND`. |
| `GET /access/audit?limit=100` | admin | `[ { _id, actorName, text, createdAt } ]` newest first |
| `PATCH /member/:id` | admin | **add `role: 'admin'\|'member'`** (see section 2) |

Non-admin callers of `/access/config|users|audit` -> `403 FORBIDDEN`.

### 5.1 Enforcement - add the permission check to these routes

Return `403 { code: 'PERMISSION_DENIED', message, permission: '<key>' }` when `access.enabled` and the key is missing.
Run the check **before** the existing authorization so the answer is consistent.

| Route(s) | Key |
|---|---|
| `GET /task`, `GET /task/:id`, `GET /taskAssignment*` | `view.tasks` (assignments list: `view.assignments` for `/taskAssignment/mine`) |
| `GET /team`, `GET /team/:id` | `view.teams` |
| `GET /member`, `GET /member/all` | `view.members` (always allow `GET /member/profile`) |
| `GET /dashboard*`, `GET /activity` (feed pages) | `view.reports` |
| `POST /task/createTask` | `task.create` |
| `PATCH /task/:id`, `POST/PATCH/DELETE /task/:id/subtasks*` | `task.edit` |
| `DELETE /task/:id`, `POST /task/:id/restore`, `POST /task/bulkDelete`, `POST /task/bulkRestore` | `task.delete` |
| `POST /taskAssignment/addMemberToTask`, `.../removeMemberFromTask` | `task.assign` |
| `PATCH /taskAssignment/taskStatusByMember`, `POST /taskAssignment/bulkStatus`, `POST /task/:id/complete-and-spawn` | `task.status` |
| `POST /task/:id/comments` (and own `PATCH`/`DELETE`) | `task.comment` |
| `POST /task/:id/attachments` (and own `DELETE`) | `task.attach` |
| `POST /task/:id/time` (and own `DELETE`) | `task.logTime` |
| `POST /task/:id/share`, `DELETE /task/:id/share` | `task.share` |
| `POST /team/createTeam` | `team.create` |
| `POST /team/addMemberToTeam`, `removeMemberFromTeam`, `updateMemberRoleInTeam`, `updateTeamName` | `team.manage` |
| `POST /team/deleteTeam`, `POST /team/restore` | `team.delete` |
| `POST /member/createMember` | `member.invite` |
| `PATCH/DELETE /member/:id`, `/member/:id/active`, `/member/:id/resetPassword` | `member.edit` (a person may always `PATCH` **their own** name/picture) |
| `GET /export/*` | `report.export` |

Notes
- A `view.*` key being blocked means the **data** is not returned: answer `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`, not an empty list, so the UI can tell "no access" from "nothing yet".
- Notifications, preferences, sessions, push and the person's own profile are never gated.
- SSE / `/changes`: only send events for entities the person may read.

## 6. Realtime and caching

- Add an `access` group to `GET /changes` (`{ upserted: ['config'|memberId], deleted: [] }`) and an SSE event `access.updated`, so a user whose permissions change sees the UI update without a reload (the frontend then re-calls `GET /access/me`).
- `GET /access/me` is cheap and may be cached for a few seconds per user; bust the cache on any `PUT /access/*` and on role changes.
- A permission change must apply to already-issued tokens immediately (resolve permissions per request from the database, not from the JWT).

## 7. Edge cases the tests will check

1. `enabled=false`: no `PERMISSION_DENIED` anywhere, even if overrides exist.
2. Block wins: preset has `task.create`, override `deny:['task.create']` -> 403; override `allow` + preset removed -> allowed.
3. Admin is never blocked, even if someone writes `deny` for an admin (store it, ignore it in resolution).
4. Changing the Member preset affects everyone with that role at once; overrides stay.
5. Viewer: `403 VIEWER_READ_ONLY` still wins on mutations even if the permission is `allow`.
6. Last admin cannot be demoted or deleted; nobody can change their own role.
7. Unknown permission key in a body -> `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
8. Deleting a member removes their override; re-creating the email starts clean.
9. Every change writes an audit row (who, what, before/after); `GET /access/audit` returns them newest first.
10. Concurrent edits: `PUT /access/users/:id` is last-write-wins but returns the saved state.

## 8. How we will verify

`tests/e2e/integration.spec.js`, test **"access control: master switch, per-person block, role presets, enforced by the server"**
(also `tests/e2e/more.spec.js` for the Demo Mode version). Point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at your staging and run
`npx playwright test --project=integration`. It checks: switch on/off, a blocked person gets `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` with `permission: 'task.create'`,
`/access/me` of that person lacks the key, the Member preset change reaches `/access/me`, non-admins get 403 on `PUT /access/config`,
and turning the switch off lifts the restriction immediately.

Please send back: staging URL, any key you renamed or added (keep the strings in section 3 stable), and the migration notes.
